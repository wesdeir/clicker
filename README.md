# Mimic: Statistical Ghost Clicker & Benchmark Suite

Mimic is an advanced automation framework designed to simulate human clicking patterns with high statistical fidelity. Unlike traditional macro software that uses fixed delays or simple randomization, Mimic employs a statistical distribution engine (Gaussian and Weibull) to generate click timings that closely resemble human physiological performance.

This project includes two core components:
1. **Mimic v3.7**: The primary automation engine with real-time risk assessment and adaptive pattern switching.
2. **Mimic Benchmark Tool**: A standalone analytics utility for recording, analyzing, and benchmarking clicking performance (CPS, consistency, and fatigue).

## Features

### **Core Functionality**
- **Hold-to-Click Activation** - Natural left-click hold interface using pynput [web:112]
- **Adaptive Mixed Mode** - Dynamically blends butterfly/jitter/normal clicking techniques
- **Statistical Engine** - Gaussian (Box-Muller) + Weibull distributions for realistic delays
- **Variance Targeting** - Configurable 1,500-2,500 variance range (optimal for AGC bypass)
- **Real-Time Risk Assessment** - Live detection risk scoring (0-100)

### **Anti-Detection Systems**
- Pattern break detection with dynamic adjustment
- 2% outlier injection (micro-pauses, panic bursts)
- Session re-randomization for behavioral diversity
- Drift accumulation and rhythm oscillation
- Configurable burst/pause mechanics

### **Analysis & Training**
- Real-time CPS graphing and delay distribution histograms
- Human baseline training mode (butterfly/jitter/normal)
- Differential analysis (compare human vs bot patterns)
- Session history tracking with JSON persistence
- CSV/TXT export for external analysis

## Testing Strategy

Based on anti-cheat research for 1.8.9 PvP servers [web:75][web:84]:

### **Phase 1: Hypixel (Week 1)**
- Server: `mc.hypixel.net`
- Anti-Cheat: Watchdog
- Goal: 30+ minute sessions undetected
- Game Modes: Duels → BedWars/SkyWars

### **Phase 2: Extended Testing (Week 2)**
- Increase to 1-2 hour sessions
- Monitor variance/CPS when flagged (if any)
- Adjust settings based on results

### **Phase 3: MMC Final Test (Week 3+)**
- Server: `na.minemen.club` / `eu.minemen.club`
- Anti-Cheat: AGC (AntiGamingChair) - Most strict
- Goal: 30+ minutes undetected = success
- **Use alt accounts for testing**

---

## Advanced Tuning

Accessible in **Settings → Advanced Tuning**:

- **Pause Probability:** 0-20% (default: 10%)
- **Pause Duration:** 50-500ms (default: 200-450ms)
- **Burst Probability:** 0-50% (default: 20%)
- **Target Variance:** 800-3500 (default: 2200)

Fine-tune these during gameplay to balance hit registration vs detection risk.
