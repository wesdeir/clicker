## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Smart CPS Control**: Dynamically maintains 7-12 CPS with natural variation
- **Human-Like Patterns**: Combines Gaussian and Weibull distributions for realistic timing
- **Anti-Detection System**: Multiple layers of randomness to evade pattern detection
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live statistics dashboard with variance tracking
- **Session Analytics**: Comprehensive post-session reports with performance analysis

### Advanced Anti-Detection
- **Pattern Breaking**: Automatically detects and disrupts robotic patterns
- **Variance Monitoring**: Maintains variance above bot-detection thresholds
- **Temporal Drift**: Simulates natural speed variations over time
- **Momentum Simulation**: Realistic acceleration during click combos
- **Rhythmic Variation**: Natural human rhythm patterns
